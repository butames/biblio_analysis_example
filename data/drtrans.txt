   abstract = {This manual introduces the AUDIT, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, and describes how to use it to identify persons with hazardous and harmful patterns of alcohol consumption. The AUDIT was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a simple method of screening for excessive drinking and to assist in brief assessment. It can help in identifying excessive drinking as the cause of the presenting illness. It also provides a framework for intervention to help hazardous and harmful drinkers reduce or cease alcohol consumption and thereby avoid the harmful consequences of their drinking. The first edition of this manual was published in 1989 (Document No. WHO/MNH/DAT/89.4) and was subsequently updated in 1992 (WHO/PSA/92.4). Since that time it has enjoyed widespread use by both health workers and alcohol researchers. With the growing use of alcohol screening and the international popularity of the AUDIT, there was a need to revise the manual to take into account advances in research and clinical experience.},

   abstract = {Men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women are disproportionately affected by HIV in the Dominican Republic. Little is known about their experiences living with HIV as a chronic condition. We explored employment as a social determinant of well-being with HIV. We conducted 42 qualitative in-depth interviews with MSM (n = 16) and transgender women (n = 5) living with HIV; each participant completed 2 interviews to facilitate depth and iterative analysis. We used narrative analysis and systematic coding to identify salient themes related to employment and the HIV experience and developed a conceptual model of the pathways between HIV stigma, unemployment, and HIV outcomes. Early life experiences, including rejection from families and school, resulted in limited work opportunities, especially among transgender women. Following HIV diagnosis, participants across all socio-economic levels lost jobs and/or were unable to get jobs due to illegal HIV testing and HIV stigma and discrimination. Not being able to work impacted mental health, engagement in HIV care, and overall well-being. We conclude that lack of employment is a salient concern among MSM and transgender women living with HIV. Holistic, multi-level programmes that address illegal HIV testing and discriminatory hiring practices are urgently needed to facilitate engagement in care and long-term well-being.},

Design A cross-sectional study of a convenience sample of GMT persons. Setting The study was conducted in the province of La Romana, Dominican Republic, in June–July 2013. Participants Out of 117 GMT persons screened, a total of 100 completed the study. Participants had to be at least 18 years of age, reside in La Romana and have had sex with another man in the preceding 12 months. All participants were interviewed and tested for STI. Primary outcome measure The main outcome of interest was the detection of any STI (HIV, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), syphilis, hepatitis B or C) by serology. Results Among 100 participants, the median age was 22 years (range 18–65). One-third had consumed illicit drugs the preceding year and only 43% consistently used condoms. Prevalence was 38% for HSV-2, 5% for HIV and 13% for syphilis. There were no cases of hepatitis B or C. Factors associated with the odds of a STI were age >22 years (OR=11.1, 95% CI 3.6 to 34.5), receptive anal intercourse (OR=4.2, 95% CI 1.3 to 13.6) and having ≥2 male sexual partners during the preceding month (OR=4, 95% CI 1.3 to 12.5). Conclusions In this group of GMT persons, seroprevalence of STI was high, and a number of risk behaviours were associated with STI. These preliminary data will help inform policy and programmes to prevent HIV/STI in GMT persons in the region.},

   journal = {Journal of the International AIDS Society},
   volume = {19},
   abstract = {Transgender (trans) activists and global health partners have collaborated to develop new tools and guidance for assessing and addressing HIV and other health needs within trans populations. Trans women experience a heavy burden of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), high incidence of violence and difficulties accessing gender-Affirming services. At the same time, little has been published on trans men's health, HIV issues, needs and experiences. Young trans people are especially marginalized and vulnerable, with few programmes and services specifically tailored to their needs. Trans-specific data and guidance are needed to adapt the global response to HIV to meet the needs of the trans population. While the needs of this group have only recently received attention, global, regional and other technical guidance documents are being developed to address these gaps. Regional blueprints for comprehensive care for trans people in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Asia and the Pacific are now available. These tools-supported by the Pan American Health Organization,World Health Organization, US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the United Nations Development Programme, in collaboration with regional trans groups-provide a contextual map, indicating opportunities for interventions in health, HIV, violence, stigma and discrimination, social protection and human rights. Global guidance includes the World Health Organization's Policy Brief: Transgender People and HIV, and the interagency publication, Implementing Comprehensive HIV and STI Programmes with Transgender People. Community empowerment and capacity building are the focus of the new tools for global and regional transgender guidance. The goal is to strengthen and ensure community-led responses to the HIV challenge in trans populations. This article describes the new tools and guidance and considers the steps needed to use them to appropriately support and engage transgender populations within national AIDS, STI, and sexual and reproductive health responses and programmes. The time to use these tools and guidance for advocacy, strategic planning, capacity building, programme design and training is now.},

   abstract = {An estimated 499 million curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs; gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and trichomoniasis) occurred globally in 2008. In addition, well over 500 million people are estimated to have a viral STI such as herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) or human papillomavirus (HPV) at any point in time. STIs result in a large global burden of sexual, reproductive, and maternal-child health consequences, including genital symptoms, pregnancy complications, cancer, infertility, and enhanced HIV transmission, as well as important psychosocial consequences and financial costs. STI control strategies based primarily on behavioral primary prevention and STI case management have had clear successes, but gains have not been universal. Current STI control is hampered or threatened by several behavioral, biological, and implementation challenges, including a large proportion of asymptomatic infections, lack of feasible diagnostic tests globally, antimicrobial resistance, repeat infections, and barriers to intervention access, availability, and scale-up. Vaccines against HPV and hepatitis B virus offer a new paradigm for STI control. Challenges to existing STI prevention efforts provide important reasons for working toward additional STI vaccines. We summarize the global epidemiology of STIs and STI-associated complications, examine challenges to existing STI prevention efforts, and discuss the need for new STI vaccines for future prevention efforts.},

   title = {Stigma and intersectionality: A systematic review of systematic reviews across HIV/AIDS, mental illness, and physical disability},
   journal = {BMC Public Health},
   volume = {18},
   number = {1},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND Stigma across HIV/AIDS, mental illness, and physical disability can be co-occurring and may interact with other forms of stigma related to social identities like race, gender, and sexuality. Stigma is especially problematic for people living with these conditions because it can create barriers to accessing necessary social and structural supports, which can intensify their experiences with stigma. This review aims to contribute to the knowledge on stigma by advancing a cross-analysis of HIV/AIDS, mental illness, and physical disability stigma, and exploring whether and how intersectionality frameworks have been used in the systematic reviews of stigma. METHODS A search of the literature was conducted to identify systematic reviews which investigated stigma for HIV/AIDS, mental illness and/or physical disability. The electronic databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, COCHRANE, and PsycINFO were searched for reviews published between 2005 and 2017. Data were extracted from eligible reviews on: type of systematic review and number of primary studies included in the review, study design study population(s), type(s) of stigma addressed, and destigmatizing interventions used. A keyword search was also done using the terms "intersectionality", "intersectional", and "intersection"; related definitions and descriptions were extracted. Matrices were used to compare the characteristics of reviews and their application of intersectional approaches across the three health conditions. RESULTS Ninety-eight reviews met the inclusion criteria. The majority (99%) of reviews examined only one of the health conditions. Just three reviews focused on physical disability. Most reviews (94%) reported a predominance of behavioural rather than structural interventions targeting stigma in the primary studies. Only 17% of reviews used the concept and/or approach of intersectionality; all but one of these reviews examined HIV/AIDS. CONCLUSIONS The lack of systematic reviews comparing stigma across mental illness, HIV/AIDS, and physical disability indicates the need for more cross-comparative analyses among these conditions. The integration of intersectional approaches would deepen interrogations of co-occurring social identities and stigma.},

Eligible men were aged ≥15 years, reported engaging in anal/oral sex with another man within the past six months and living in one of the four cities sampled. GTMSM were recruited in Santo Domingo (n = 510), Barahona (n = 281), La Altagracia (n = 270) and Santiago (n = 327). HIV seroprevalence ranged from 5.1% to 7.6%. HBV ranged from 0.6% to 3.5%, HCV from 0.8% to 6.9% and syphilis from 3.5% to 6.9%. GTM practice numerous risky sexual behaviours including having multiple sex partners and practising inconsistent condom use with male and female, including transactional, sex partners. Although we found lower HIV prevalence compared with previous studies, the high level of extremely risky sexual behaviours practised by GTM in the Dominican Republic will most likely result in increases in HIV and other infections if action is not taken to scale-up effective prevention programmes for this population.},

   abstract = {Transgender women are overrepresented in the Caribbean HIV epidemic. The study objective was to examine correlates of HIV infection and HIV testing among transgender women in Jamaica. We implemented a cross-sectional survey with transgender women in Kingston and Ocho Rios, Jamaica. We conducted multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with HIV testing and HIV infection. Among 137 transgender women [mean age 24.0; standard deviation (SD) 5.5], three-quarters (n = 103, 75.7%) had received an HIV test. Of these, one-quarter (n = 26, 25.2%) were HIV positive. In multivariable analyses, HIV testing was associated with: perceived HIV risk [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.42, confidence interval (CI) 1.36–4.28], depression (AOR 1.34, CI 1.01–1.77), forced sex (AOR 3.83, CI 1.42–10.35), physical abuse (AOR 4.11, CI 1.44–11.72), perceived transgender stigma (AOR 1.23, 1.06–1.42), having a healthcare provider (AOR 5.89, CI 1.46–23.77), and lower HIV-related stigma (AOR 0.96, CI 0.92–0.99), incarceration (AOR 0.28, CI 0.10–0.78), and drug use (AOR 0.74, CI 0.58–0.95). HIV infection was associated with the following: homelessness (AOR 5.94, CI 1.27–27.74), perceived HIV risk (AOR 1.67, CI 1.02–2.72), depression (AOR 1.39, CI 1.06–1.82), STI history (AOR 56.79, CI 5.12–630.33), perceived (AOR 1.26, CI 1.06–1.51) and enacted (AOR 1.16, CI 1.04–1.29) transgender stigma, forced sex (AOR 4.14, CI 1.49–11.51), physical abuse (AOR 3.75, CI 1.39–10.12), and lower self-rated health (AOR 0.55, CI 0.30–0.98) and social support (AOR 0.79, CI 0.64–0.97). Transgender women in Jamaica experience high HIV infection rates and suboptimal HIV testing.

The study objective was to examine factors associated with sex work involvement among transgender women in Jamaica. METHODS In 2015, we implemented a cross-sectional survey using modified peer-driven recruitment with transgender women in Kingston and Ocho Rios, Jamaica, in collaboration with a local community-based AIDS service organization. We conducted multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with paid sex and transactional sex. Exchanging oral, anal or vaginal sex for money only was categorized as paid sex. Exchanging sex for survival needs (food, accommodation, transportation), drugs or alcohol, or for money along with survival needs and/or drugs/alcohol, was categorized as transactional sex. RESULTS Among 137 transgender women (mean age: 24.0 [SD: 4.5]), two-thirds reported living in the Kingston area. Overall, 25.2% reported being HIV-positive. Approximately half (n = 71; 51.82%) reported any sex work involvement, this included sex in exchange for: money (n = 64; 47.06%); survival needs (n = 27; 19.85%); and drugs/alcohol (n = 6; 4.41%). In multivariable analyses, paid sex and transactional sex were both associated with: intrapersonal (depression), interpersonal (lower social support, forced sex, childhood sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, multiple partners/polyamory), and structural (transgender stigma, unemployment) factors. Participants reporting transactional sex also reported increased odds of incarceration perceived to be due to transgender identity, forced sex, homelessness, and lower resilience, in comparison with participants reporting no sex work involvement. CONCLUSION Findings reveal high HIV infection rates among transgender women in Jamaica. Sex work-involved participants experience social and structural drivers of HIV, including violence, stigma, and unemployment. Transgender women involved in transactional sex also experience high rates of incarceration, forced sex and homelessness in comparison with non-sex workers. Taken together, these findings suggest that social ecological factors elevate HIV exposure among sex work-involved transgender women in Jamaica. Findings can inform interventions to advance human rights and HIV prevention and care cascades with transgender women in Jamaica.},

   abstract = {Background: Advances in HIV care have resulted in increasing numbers of HIV patients receiving antiretroviral therapy and achieving viral control. This has led to a focus on the biomedical aspects of care, leaving the data on psychological and social problems relatively neglected; in fact they have never before been systematically reviewed. If present and unmanaged, psychological and social problems are associated with unnecessary suffering and non-adherence to medication, with potentially serious clinical and public health consequences. Objective: To assess the prevalence of depression and anxiety reported in the literature, and the presence or absence of the experience of stigma among HIV positive people on antiretroviral therapy. Design and review methods: A systematic review in line with PRISMA guidelines. The prevalence data from retained studies were analysed by study location and data quality. Data sources: Five databases were systematically searched (Embase, PsychINFO, MEDLINE and British Nursing index and Web of Science) from 1996 (first availability of highly effective antiretroviral therapy) to August 2013 using a predefined search strategy. Results: Sixty-six original studies identified the prevalence of depression, anxiety and presence or absence of the experience of stigma. The mean point prevalence of depression was 33.60% (SD 19.47) with lower reported point prevalence in high income countries (25.81% (15.21)) compared to low and middle income countries (41.36% (21.42)). The one-to four-week period prevalence of depression was 39.79% (21.52), similar in high income countries and low and middle income countries. The point prevalence of anxiety was 28.38% (17.07), with a higher prevalence in low and middle income countries (33.92% (10.64)) compared with high income countries (21.53% (22.91)) with wide variability. The mean point prevalence of stigma was 53.97% (22.06) and 1 year period prevalence 52.11% (25.57). Heterogeneity in both sampling and methodology prevented meta-analysis of this data. Conclusion: HIV positive patients on antiretroviral therapy report a higher prevalence of depression and anxiety than the general population, which nursing assessment and practice should address. Over half of HIV positive people report experiencing stigma. The difficulties with heterogeneous studies should be addressed through the development of a cross-culturally validated, multidimensional assessment tool in this population, and an increase in data disaggregated by risk groups. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

With the aim of systematically reviewing the available literature in this field, this study identifies 31 papers that explore the rates of NSSI and suicidality in trans people. From reviewing the literature, it was revealed that trans people have a higher prevalence of NSSI and suicidality compared to the cisgender (non-trans) population. There appear to be some gender differences within these rates, with trans men at a greater risk for NSSI behaviour. Prevalence rates differ depending on the different stages of transition, but they are still overall greater than the cisgender population. The study concludes that trans individuals are at a greater risk of NSSI behaviour and suicidality than the cisgender population, and discusses risk factors and the need to develop effective preventative interventions.},

More than half of Latina and White participants were depressed on the basis of Center For Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale scores. About three quarters of White participants reported ever having suicidal ideation, of whom 64% reported suicide attempts. Half of the participants reported being physically assaulted, and 38% reported being raped or sexually assaulted before age 18 years. White and African American participants reported transphobia experiences more frequently than did others. Social support, transphobia, suicidal ideation, and levels of income and education were significantly and independently correlated with depression.Conclusions. For THSW, psychological vulnerability must be addressed in counseling, support groups, and health promotion programs specifically tailored to race/ethnicity.},

   abstract = {While theories of “structure” and social inequality have increasingly informed global health efforts for HIV prevention—with growing recognition of the linkages between large-scale political and economic factors in the distribution and impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic—there is still little theorization of precisely how structural factors shape the very bodies and sexualities of specific populations and groups. In order to extend the theoretical understanding of these macro-micro linkages, this article examines how the growth of the tourism industry in the Dominican Republic has produced sexual practices and identities that reflect both the influence of large-scale structural processes and the resistant responses of local individuals. Drawing on social science theories of political economy, embodiment, and authenticity, I argue that an understanding of patterns of sexuality and HIV risk in the region requires analysis of how political-economic transformations related to tourism intersect with the individual experiences and practices of sexuality on the ground. The analysis draws on long-term ethnographic research with bisexually behaving male sex workers in two cities in the Dominican Republic, including participant observation, in-depth interviews, focus groups, and surveys. By examining the global and local values placed on these men’s bodies and the ways sex workers use their bodies to broker tourists’ pleasure, we may better understand how the large-scale structures of the tourism industry are linked to the specific meanings and practices of sexuality.},

Since the HIV epidemic began, the Region of the Americas has spearheaded the global response to HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), pursuing efforts based on a public health and human rights approach. While progress has been made, significant gaps and challenges persist, and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and its Member States must now strengthen their capacity to undertake innovative and effective strategies to address these epidemics and pave the way towards their elimination as public health problems. This Plan describes the strategic lines of action to be implemented by Member States and the Pan American Sanitary Bureau (PASB) between 2016 and 2021, as they strive to enhance and expand the prevention and control of HIV and STIs1 in the Americas. This Plan sets forth a blueprint for Member States to use as they deem appropriate and considering their contexts, needs, and priorities, to attain an accelerated, focused, innovative, effective, and sustainable response to HIV/STIs in the Region of the Americas, based on a public health, human rights, gender equality, and intercultural approach. The Plan also aims at achieving universal access to health and universal health coverage by delivering comprehensive, quality, universal and progressively expanded HIV/STI prevention, care, and treatment services through integrated health services networks, with active participation of civil society2 and a people- and community-centered approach focusing on key populations and others in situation of vulnerability.},

Design:Cross-sectional study of MSM recruited from a variety of community settings. Methods:A total of 354 men agreed to participate after giving verbal informed consent. Information was obtained using a standardized questionnaire assessing demographics and AIDS-relevant information. Blood was obtained for HIV and syphilis testing. Results:Five main sexual identity groups emerged: cross dressers, homosexuals, gigolos, bisexuals and heterosexuals. Receptive anal and oral intercourse were commonly reported by men self-identifying as cross dressers or homosexuals, whereas nearly all of the remaining three groups practiced only insertive intercourse. Sexual contact with women was also commonly reported; overall, consistent condom use was infrequent. HIV antibodies were detected in 11.0% and serologic evidence of syphilis was found in 7.3%. Factors independently associated with HIV infection included serologic evidence of syphilis, having visited at least one of four local brothels in 1975–1985, and having had receptive anal intercourse with four or more partners in the last 12 months. Conclusions:Syphilis, sexual practices and social context of sex (commercial sex), rather than sexual identity per se, were associated with HIV infection. The complex social networks of MSM in this setting, the tendency to practice either insertive or receptive sex, but not both, infrequent condom use, high rates of syphilis and the frequency of sex with women need to be taken into account for targeted HIV prevention programs to be successful. © Lippincott-Raven Publishers.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Despite the higher risk of HIV among female sex workers (FSWs), men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW), these populations are under-represented in the literature on HIV in Haiti. Here, we present the first nationally representative estimates of HIV prevalence and the first care and treatment cascade for FSWs, MSM and TGW in Haiti. We also examine the social determinants of HIV prevalence in these groups and estimate FSW and MSM population size in Haiti. METHODS: Data were collected between April 2016 and February 2017 throughout the 10 geographical departments of Haiti. The Priorities for Local AIDS Control Efforts (PLACE) method was used to: (1) recruit participants for a behavioural survey; (2) provide rapid testing, counselling and linkage to care for syphilis and HIV; and (3) measure viral load using dried blood spots for participants testing HIV positive. RESULTS: Study participants included 990 FSWs, 520 MSM and 109 TGW. HIV prevalence was estimated at 7.7% (95% CI 6.2%, 9.6%) among FSWs, 2.2% (0.9%, 5.3%) among MSM and 27.6% (5.0%, 73.5%) among TGW. Of participants who tested positive for syphilis, 17% of FSWs, 19% of MSM and 74% of TGW were co-infected with HIV. Economic instability and intimate partner violence (IPV) were significantly associated with HIV among MSM; food insecurity, economic instability and history of rape were significantly associated with HIV among TGW. Fewer than one-third of participants living with HIV knew their status, and more than a quarter of those who knew their status were not on treatment. While approximately four in five FSW and MSM participants on treatment for HIV were virally suppressed, viral suppression was less common among TGW participants at only 46%. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a need for targeted interventions to prevent and treat HIV among key populations in Haiti. Potential high-impact interventions may include venue-based, peer navigator-led outreach and testing for HIV and syphilis and improving screening and case management for structural violence and IPV. TGW are in urgent need of such interventions due to our observations of alarmingly high HIV prevalence and low frequency of HIV viral suppression among TGW.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe syphilis prevalence in men who have sex with men (MSM), the transgender population, and sex workers and their clients, identifying critical geographical areas, trends, and data gaps in Latin America and the Caribbean. METHODS: A systematic review of syphilis prevalence was conducted by searching PubMed, LILACS, EMBASE, conference records, and other sources (2000-2010). RESULTS: Forty-eight articles were included in the review, from which 84 data points were identified relating to MSM and female sex workers and only 10 relating to the transgender population, male sex workers, and clients of sex workers. Most studies were from Latin America (83%), with fewer from the Caribbean (17%). Critical 'hotspot' cities were Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Guatemala, Puerto Barrios, San José, San Pedro, Managua, San Salvador, and Acajutla, with high syphilis prevalence in more than one study population. Gaps in the availability of information on syphilis prevalence were identified for Ecuador, Uruguay, and Bolivia, and most countries in the Caribbean. Chronological trends showed that syphilis infection is well-established among the study populations. CONCLUSIONS: Consistently high levels of syphilis among the investigated populations throughout the study period show that there is a need to improve monitoring, surveillance, and evaluation of sexually transmitted infection control interventions among these populations. Improved reporting and standardization of syphilis testing is recommended, as well as a heightened focus on more effective syphilis control strategies.},

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the analysis was to explore HIV-1 subtype diversity in the 
      United States and understand differences in prevalence of non-B subtypes and 
      circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) between demographic/risk groups and over time. 
      METHODS: We included HIV-1 polymerase sequences reported to the National HIV 
      Surveillance System for HIV infections diagnosed during 2006-2013 in seven states. 
      We assigned subtype or CRF using the automated subtyping tool COMET, assessed 
      subtype/CRF prevalence by demographic characteristics and country of birth, and 
      determined changes in subtype/CRF by HIV diagnosis year. RESULTS: Of 32,968 
      sequences, 30,757 (93.3%) were subtype B. The most common non-B subtypes and CRFs 
      were C (1.6%), CRF02_AG (1.4%), A (0.6%), CRF01_AE (0.5%), and G (0.3%). Elevated 
      percentages of non-B infections occurred among persons aged <13 years at diagnosis 
      (40.9%), Asians (32.1%), persons born outside the United States (22.6%), and persons 
      with infection attributable to heterosexual contact (12.0%-15.0%). Prevalence of 
      non-B infections increased from 5.9% in 2006 to 8.5% in 2013. CONCLUSIONS: Subtype B 
      continues to predominate in the United States. However, the percentage of non-B 
      infections has grown in recent years, and numerous demographic subgroups have much 
      higher prevalence. Subgroups and areas with high prevalence of non-B infections 
      might represent sub-epidemics meriting further investigation.

TI  - Black Cisgender Women's PrEP Knowledge, Attitudes, Preferences, and Experience in 
      Chicago.
PG  - 497-507
LID - 10.1097/QAI.0000000000002377 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although black cisgender women in Chicago continue to disproportionally 
      account for new HIV diagnoses, few are on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). We used 
      concurrent mixed-methods to understand women's PrEP knowledge, attitudes, 
      experience, and preferences in Chicago. SETTING AND METHODS: We surveyed 370 HIV(-) 
      cisgender women visiting a sexually transmitted infection clinic (n = 120) or 
      emergency department (n = 250). Two focus groups were conducted with PrEP-naive 
      women, and interviews were conducted with 7 PrEP-experienced women. Quantitative 
      data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic 
      regression, and qualitative data using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Majority of women 
      identified as black (83.0%) and had a regular source of health care (70.0%). In the 
      past 6 months, 84.1% had vaginal or anal sex, most with inconsistent condom use 
      (94.2%). Only 30.3% had heard of PrEP, but once explained, one-quarter considered 
      starting PrEP, with protecting health (76.4%) and reducing HIV worry (58.1%) the 
      most common reasons. Factors associated with considering PrEP included being Latina 
      [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 3.30, 95% confidence interval (CI): (1.21 to 8.99)], 
      recent sexually transmitted infection [aOR: 2.39, 95% CI: (1.25 to 4.59)], and 
      higher belief in PrEP effectiveness [aOR: 1.85, 95% CI: (1.22 to 2.82)]. Most 
      (81.1%) had concerns about taking PrEP with side effects a common concern. 
      Qualitative themes aligned with survey results, revealing a disconnection from 
      current PrEP marketing, need for community-level PrEP education/outreach, and 
      importance of provider trust. LESSONS LEARNED: Despite significant PrEP 
      implementation work in Chicago, less than one-third of women in our study had heard 
      of PrEP. Once informed, PrEP attitudes and interest were positive. Translating these 
      results into interventions reflecting women's preferences and barriers is critical 
      to increase PrEP uptake by cisgender women in Chicago and elsewhere.

TI  - High Human Immunodeficiency Virus Incidence and Prevalence and Associated Factors 
      Among Adolescent Sexual Minority Males-3 Cities, 2015.
PG  - 936-944
LID - 10.1093/cid/cix902 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Much has been written about the impact of human immunodeficiency virus 
      (HIV) among young (13-24) sexual minority men (SMM). Evidence for concern is 
      substantial for emerging adult (18-24 years) SMM. Data documenting the burden and 
      associated risk factors of HIV among adolescent SMM (<18 years) remain limited. 
      METHODS: Adolescent SMM aged 13-18 years were recruited in 3 cities (Chicago, New 
      York City, and Philadelphia) for interview and HIV testing. We used χ2 tests for 
      percentages of binary variables and 1-way analysis of variance for means of 
      continuous variables to assess differences by race/ethnicity in behaviors. We 
      calculated estimated annual HIV incidence density (number of HIV infections per 100 
      person-years [PY] at risk). We computed Fisher's exact tests to determine 
      differences in HIV prevalence by selected characteristics. RESULTS: Of 415 sexually 
      active adolescent SMM with a valid HIV test result, 25 (6%) had a positive test. 
      Estimated annual HIV incidence density was 3.4/100 PY; incidence density was highest 
      for blacks, followed by Hispanics, then whites (4.1, 3.2, and 1.1/100 PY, 
      respectively). Factors associated with higher HIV prevalence included black race; ≥4 
      male partners, condomless anal sex, and exchange sex in the past 12 months; and a 
      recent partner who was older, black, HIV-infected, or had ever been in jail or 
      prison (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: HIV-related risk behaviors, prevalence, and estimated 
      incidence density for adolescent SMM were high, especially for minority SMM. Our 
      findings suggest that initiating intervention efforts early may be helpful in 
      combating these trends.

TI  - HIV Infection Linked to Injection Use of Oxymorphone in Indiana, 2014-2015.
PG  - 229-39
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1515195 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In January 2015, a total of 11 new diagnoses of human immunodeficiency 
      virus (HIV) infection were reported in a small community in Indiana. We investigated 
      the extent and cause of the outbreak and implemented control measures. METHODS: We 
      identified an outbreak-related case as laboratory-confirmed HIV infection newly 
      diagnosed after October 1, 2014, in a person who either resided in Scott County, 
      Indiana, or was named by another case patient as a syringe-sharing or sexual 
      partner. HIV polymerase (pol) sequences from case patients were phylogenetically 
      analyzed, and potential risk factors associated with HIV infection were ascertained. 
      RESULTS: From November 18, 2014, to November 1, 2015, HIV infection was diagnosed in 
      181 case patients. Most of these patients (87.8%) reported having injected the 
      extended-release formulation of the prescription opioid oxymorphone, and 92.3% were 
      coinfected with hepatitis C virus. Among 159 case patients who had an HIV type 1 pol 
      gene sequence, 157 (98.7%) had sequences that were highly related, as determined by 
      phylogenetic analyses. Contact tracing investigations led to the identification of 
      536 persons who were named as contacts of case patients; 468 of these contacts 
      (87.3%) were located, assessed for risk, tested for HIV, and, if infected, linked to 
      care. The number of times a contact was named as a syringe-sharing partner by a case 
      patient was significantly associated with the risk of HIV infection (adjusted risk 
      ratio for each time named, 1.9; P<0.001). In response to this outbreak, a public 
      health emergency was declared on March 26, 2015, and a syringe-service program in 
      Indiana was established for the first time. CONCLUSIONS: Injection-drug use of 
      extended-release oxymorphone within a network of persons who inject drugs in Indiana 
      led to the introduction and rapid transmission of HIV. (Funded by the state 
      government of Indiana and others.).

TI  - A Proportion of Self-Collected Rectal Swabs Yield Human Immunodeficiency Virus 
      Sequences Phylogenetically Related to Those from Plasma Human Immunodeficiency Virus 
      RNA.

AB  - We determined HIV-1 pol gene sequences from self-collected rectal swabs of 
      HIV-positive young men who have sex with men and transgender women. HIV-1 pol was 
      amplified from 39/96 (41%) rectal swabs, including 29/77 (38%) prevalent and 10/19 
      (53%) incident HIV-1 infections (p < .001). Pol did not amplify from rectal swabs 
      from participants with plasma viral load <1,000 copies/mL. Each rectal swab-derived 
      amplicon consensus sequence was most closely related to the paired plasma virion 
      RNA-derived sequence from the same participant. Results document a rectal mucosal 
      source of HIV-1 in infected persons and suggest usefulness for noninvasive study of 
      biological mechanisms underlying the epidemiologic risk to an insertive partner of 
      HIV-1 acquisition during condomless anal sex.

TI  - Estimating Effects of HIV Sequencing Data Completeness on Transmission Network 
      Patterns and Detection of Growing HIV Transmission Clusters.
PG  - 368-375
LID - 10.1089/AID.2018.0181 [doi]
AB  - HIV nucleotide sequence data can identify clusters of persons with genetically 
      similar strains suggesting transmission. We simulated the effect of lowered data 
      completeness, defined by the percent of persons with diagnosed HIV with a reported 
      sequence, on transmission patterns and detection of growing HIV transmission 
      clusters. We analyzed HIV surveillance data for persons with HIV diagnosed during 
      2008-2014 who resided in Michigan or Washington. We calculated genetic distances, 
      constructed the inferred transmission network for each jurisdiction, and compared 
      transmission network characteristics and detection of growing transmission clusters 
      in the full dataset with artificially reduced datasets. Simulating lower levels of 
      completeness resulted in decreased percentages of persons linked to a cluster from 
      high completeness (full dataset) to low completeness (5%) (Michigan: 54%-18%; 
      Washington, 46%-16%). Patterns of transmission between certain populations remained 
      robust as data completeness level was reduced. As data completeness was artificially 
      decreased, sensitivity of cluster detection substantially diminished in both states. 
      In Michigan, sensitivity decreased from 100% with the full dataset, to 62% at 50% 
      completeness and 21% at 25% completeness. In Washington, sensitivity decreased from 
      100% with the full dataset, to 71% at 50% completeness and 29% at 25% completeness. 
      Lower sequence data completeness limits the ability to detect clusters that may 
      benefit from investigation; however, inferences can be made about transmission 
      patterns even with low data completeness, given sufficient numbers. Data 
      completeness should be prioritized, as lack of or delays in detection of 
      transmission clusters could result in additional infections.

TI  - Demographic, clinical, and virologic characteristics of African-born persons with 
      HIV/AIDS in a Minnesota hospital.
PG  - 356-65
AB  - Minnesota is currently home to the tenth largest African population and the second 
      largest East African population in the United States. HIV is increasingly being 
      diagnosed in African-born persons in Minnesota. A retrospective survey was conducted 
      on all African-born patients in our HIV clinic between January 1994 and June 2005. 
      We identified 237 patients who were African-born and HIV-positive. They constituted 
      12% of patients attending the clinic within the study timeframe. There was no 
      significant difference in the ages of the African-born and non-African patients in 
      the HIV clinic. African-born patients were more likely to be women compared with 
      non-African patients (p < 0.001). Forty-three percent of the African-born patients 
      presented with AIDS as defined by CD4(+) T cell counts less than 200 cells per 
      milliliter compared to 33% of antiretroviral naïve non-African HIV patients in the 
      clinic (p < 0.001). Most patients were infected through heterosexual contact and 
      only 4% were diagnosed as a result of routine testing. Seven known HIV subtypes and 
      four unique recombinant forms were identified. The most common opportunistic 
      infection was pulmonary tuberculosis. African immigrants with HIV appear to: (1) 
      access care at later stages of HIV disease than other patients in our clinic; (2) 
      are often infected with non-B subtypes; (3) do not routinely get tested for HIV. 
      Increased awareness to this growing trend is needed for health care providers and 
      public health officials to tailor educational programs and prevention efforts for 
      African immigrants in the United States.

TI  - Determinants of HIV Phylogenetic Clustering in Chicago Among Young Black Men Who 
      Have Sex With Men From the uConnect Cohort.
PG  - 265-270
LID - 10.1097/QAI.0000000000001379 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Phylogenetic analysis determines similarities among HIV genetic 
      sequences from persons infected with HIV, identifying clusters of transmission. We 
      determined characteristics associated with both membership in an HIV transmission 
      cluster and the number of clustered sequences among a cohort of young black men who 
      have sex with men (YBMSM) in Chicago. METHODS: Pairwise genetic distances of HIV-1 
      pol sequences were collected during 2013-2016. Potential transmission ties were 
      identified among HIV-infected persons whose sequences were ≤1.5% genetically 
      distant. Putative transmission pairs were defined as ≥1 tie to another sequence. We 
      then determined demographic and risk attributes associated with both membership in 
      an HIV transmission cluster and the number of ties to the sequences from other 
      persons in the cluster. RESULTS: Of 86 available sequences, 31 (36.0%) were tied to 
      ≥1 other sequence. Through multivariable analyses, we determined that those who 
      reported symptoms of depression and those who had a higher number of confidants in 
      their network had significantly decreased odds of membership in transmission 
      clusters. We found that those who had unstable housing and who reported heavy 
      marijuana use had significantly more ties to other individuals within transmission 
      clusters, whereas those identifying as bisexual, those participating in group sex, 
      and those with higher numbers of sexual partners had significantly fewer ties. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential for combining phylogenetic and 
      individual and network attributes to target HIV control efforts to persons with 
      potentially higher transmission risk, as well as suggesting some unappreciated 
      specific predictors of transmission risk among YBMSM in Chicago for future study.

TI  - Incidence of transmitted antiretroviral drug resistance in treatment-naive 
      HIV-1-infected persons in a large South Central United States clinic.
PG  - 470-5
LID - 10.1177/1060028013519246 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transmitted drug resistance (TDR) can limit effective treatment options 
      to antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected persons and increase the risk of treatment 
      failure. Limited estimates of TDR have been reported from the South Central United 
      States. OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence of TDR in Oklahoma and to examine 
      whether TDR rates have increased with time. METHODS: This was a retrospective 
      observational study of antiretroviral-naive patients at the Infectious Diseases 
      Institute, a large infectious diseases clinic in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, who had 
      received baseline antiretroviral resistance testing. Mutations were screened using 
      the 2011 International Antiviral Society-USA Drug Resistance Mutation (DRM) update, 
      and categorized using the 2009 World Health Organization (WHO) Surveillance Drug 
      Resistance Mutation (SDRM) list. RESULTS: Genotypic sequences from 428 patients 
      revealed a 6.0% to 13.6% incidence of SDRMs between 2007 and 2011, though no 
      progression in the frequency was apparent during the study period. Primary DRMs were 
      detected in 12.6% of the sampled patients, most commonly involving nonnucleoside 
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs; 8.2%), followed by protease inhibitors 
      (PIs; 3.5%) and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs; 3.3%). The 
      K103N/S and E138A reverse transcriptase mutations were the most common DRMs 
      identified, both present in 3.5% of patients. The L90M mutation was the most 
      frequently observed PI SDRM (1.6%), while the T215C/D/I mutation was the most common 
      NRTI SDRM identified (1.9%). This study was limited by the fact that the WHO SDRM 
      list was last updated in 2009. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of DRMs in central and 
      western Oklahoma is similar to recently reported rates in the United States which 
      lack data from this region. However, the frequency of second-generation NNRTI DRMs 
      (4.4%) suggests the need to closely monitor epidemiologic trends for increasing 
      resistance rates to individual classes of ARVs in order to predict the impact of TDR 
      on therapeutic options.

TI  - Syndemic theory and HIV-related risk among young transgender women: the role of 
      multiple, co-occurring health problems and social marginalization.
PG  - 1751-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We assessed whether multiple psychosocial factors are additive in their 
      relationship to sexual risk behavior and self-reported HIV status (i.e., can be 
      characterized as a syndemic) among young transgender women and the relationship of 
      indicators of social marginalization to psychosocial factors. METHODS: Participants 
      (n = 151) were aged 15 to 24 years and lived in Chicago or Los Angeles. We collected 
      data on psychosocial factors (low self-esteem, polysubstance use, victimization 
      related to transgender identity, and intimate partner violence) and social 
      marginalization indicators (history of commercial sex work, homelessness, and 
      incarceration) through an interviewer-administered survey. RESULTS: Syndemic factors 
      were positively and additively related to sexual risk behavior and self-reported HIV 
      infection. In addition, our syndemic index was significantly related to 2 indicators 
      of social marginalization: a history of sex work and previous incarceration. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide evidence for a syndemic of co-occurring 
      psychosocial and health problems in young transgender women, taking place in a 
      context of social marginalization.
